# Secure Multiparty Computation - Shamir Secret Sharing
Brief overview on the following topics:</br>
**1. Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC):** subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.</br>
**2. Advantages and disadvantages of SMPC**.</br>
**3. Shamir Secret Sharing:** efficient secret sharing algorithm for distributing private information in such a way that no individual holds intelligible information about the secret.</br>
**4. Polynomial interpolation:** mathematical basis for Shamir Secret Sharing.</br>
**5. Advantages and disadvantages of SSS**.</br>
**6. Security problems**: security concerns on (t, n) secret sharing scheme.</br>
**7. Wallet management**: management of a Bitcoin wallet, protecting the deterministic private key using SSS.
